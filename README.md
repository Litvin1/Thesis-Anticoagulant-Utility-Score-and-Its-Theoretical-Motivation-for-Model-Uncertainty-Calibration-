# Thesis-Anticoagulant-Utility-Score-and-Its-Theoretical-Motivation-for-Model-Uncertainty-Calibration-
PDF file of the thesis table of contents:<br />
Pages 1–9: introduction. biological background: What is Venous Thrombo-Embolism (VTE)? What is the Padua score? What is major bleeding? Algorithmic background: what is machine learning? What is risk and Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)? How does Hoeffding's inequality help us? describing the datasets.
Pages 10–18: Methods. Python language and libreries, Anti-Coagulant Utility (ACU) score definition, feature selection, missing values, performance evaluation; Statistical tests: paired sample t-test, TOST (two one-sided t-tests) equivalence test, confidence intervals for a population mean, model uncertainty calibration, theoretical claims, algorithm
Pages 19–25: Results. predicting VTE with new weights for Padua variables, predicting VTE with new variables, predicting major bleeding, confidence intervals for ACU between different populations.
Pages 26–28: Discussion
Pages 29–32: Bibliography
Pages 33-37: Appendix A. Proof for the claim: if both models for predicting VTE and major bleeding are perfectly calibrated, then the conditional expectation of the ACU is higher for the population of patients who had a VTE event than the major bleeding population.
Pages 34-38: Appendix B. Proof for the claim: if both models for predicting VTE and major bleeding are perfectly calibrated, then the average ACU of a final size sample of patients who had a VTE event is higher than the average ACU of the major bleeding final sample.
